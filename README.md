# Indian_Rover_Challenge_2020_Team_Drishti
As a part of IRC compitition, we develop a rover which can perform various task like Autonomous Task, Science Task, Extreme Retriever Task, Equipment Servicing Task and Science Task.
Our software stack based on ROS (Robot Operating System).

## Autonomous Task

It have to navigate autonomously to given GPS cordinates with obstacle avoidance. And path consist of multiple arrow signs, Rover have to follow the arrows and at the end of task ball place so Rover has to reach within 2m radius of the ball.

## Science Task

We have to reach on appropiate site, then collect the sample of soil and do onboard analysis to determine the presence or absence of life, either extinact and extant. We have to capture wide-angle panorama of the side.

## Extreme Retrieval and Delievery Task

In this task we have the GPS coordinates of pickup and drop location of object. We traverce through various terrain and reach to object and pickup and drop to its given location.
